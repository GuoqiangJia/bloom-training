Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. Fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is often prohibitively costly. In this regard, PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. Recent State-of-the-Art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.
